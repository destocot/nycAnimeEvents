# Embedded Turso database replicas

Turso supports [embedded replicas](https://blog.turso.tech/introducing-embedded-replicas-deploy-turso-anywhere-2085aa0dc242). Turso's embedded replicas enable you to have a copy of your primary, remote database inside your application. Embedded replicas behave similarly to a local SQLite database. Database queries are faster because your database is inside your application.
